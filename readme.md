* Had problems deploying to production
    * This helped: Laracasts: [RuntimeException on fresh install](https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/general-discussion/runtimeexception-on-fresh-install)

* alias php 5.6 to php
```
alias php='/usr/local/bin/php55'
```
or just use php55, as in composer example below

* composer is here:
```
/usr/local/bin/composer.phar

#example
php55 /usr/local/bin/composer.phar install
```

* gulp is here:
```
./node_modules/.bin/gulp 
```
